# 🚀 Multi-Tier Architecture on AWS with Terraform

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a **secure, scalable, and resilient multi-tier infrastructure** on AWS using Terraform.  
It highlights **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** best practices, modular design, and automation for real-world cloud environments.

---

## ✨ Features
- ⚡ Automated provisioning of AWS infrastructure with Terraform  
- 🏗️ Multi-tier design: Web, Application, and Database layers  
- 🌍 High availability across multiple Availability Zones  
- 📈 Auto-scaling for dynamic traffic handling  
- 🔒 Hardened security with IAM, security groups, and network segmentation  
- ♻️ Modular Terraform structure for reusability and maintainability  
- ▶️ Single-command infrastructure deployment (`terraform apply`)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Cloud:** AWS (VPC, EC2, RDS, ELB, IAM, NAT Gateway, Subnets)  
- **IaC Tooling:** Terraform (modular code structure)  
- **Version Control:** GitHub  
- **Automation:** Infrastructure as Code with reusable variables & outputs
